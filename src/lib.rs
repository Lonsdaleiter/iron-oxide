//! `iron-oxide` provides unsafe [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal?language=objc)
//! bindings for Rust.
//!
//! Not all of Metal's functionality is added. The pointer underlying a MTL(something) can
//! be accessed with `get_ptr`, and messages can be sent to it with `objc`'s `msg_send!`, if
//! necessary functionality isn't yet implemented. This is very unsafe.
//!
//! It is the responsibility of the user to not use methods or functions which do not exist in
//! OS versions below what they support (specified in the linked Metal docs).
